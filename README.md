  ]
  // [timestamp, price, volume, bid, ask]
}

```

---

## **Historical Data Schema**

### **OHLC Bar Structure**

```json
{
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "timeframe": "1m",
  "data": [
    {
      "ts": 1705276800000,    // timestamp

---

## **Performance Optimizations**

### **Message Size Reduction**

- **Field name shortening**: `timestamp` → `ts`, `symbol` → `s`
- **Precision control**: Only required decimal places
- **Array packing**: Multiple values in single array
- **Compression**: WebSocket deflate extension

### **Bandwidth Management**

| User Type | Max Symbols | Throttle (ms) | Batch Size | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic** | 5 | 1000 | 1 | Low |
| **Premium** | 25 | 100 | 5 | Medium |
| **Pro** | 50 | 50 | 10 | High |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | 10 | 50 | Critical |

### **Adaptive Quality Control**

```
Network Quality Detection:
├── Good (>1Mbps, <50ms): Full quality, 50ms updates
├── Medium (>500kbps, <200ms): Reduced precision, 200ms updates
├── Poor (<500kbps, >200ms): Essential data only, 1s updates
└── Offline: Cache mode, no updates

```

---

## **Security & Compliance**

### **Authentication Flow**

1. **REST Login** → JWT access token + refresh token
2. **WebSocket Handshake** → JWT in `Authorization` header
3. **Token Validation** → Server validates and establishes connection
4. **Auto-Refresh** → Proactive token renewal at 90% lifetime

### **Message Integrity (Premium)**

```json
{
  "type": "tick",
  "data": {...},
  "signature": "sha256_hmac",
  "nonce": "uuid_v4"
}

```

### **Rate Limiting Strategy**

- **Per-connection**: 1000 messages/second
- **Per-user**: 50 symbols maximum
- **Per-IP**: 10 connections maximum
- **Global**: Circuit breaker at 95% capacity

---

## **Fallback & Resilience**

### **Protocol Fallback Chain**

```
WebSocket → SSE → Long Polling → Regular Polling
    ↓         ↓         ↓            ↓
  <50ms    <100ms    <500ms      <5000ms

```

### **Data Recovery**

| Scenario | Recovery Method | Time to Recover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Short disconnect** (<30s) | Request missing sequences | <2s |
| **Medium disconnect** (30s-5min) | Historical data backfill | <10s |
| **Long disconnect** (>5min) | Full chart reload | <30s |
| **Symbol unavailable** | Fallback to cached data | Immediate |

### **Connection Health Monitoring**

- **Heartbeat interval**: 30 seconds
- **Connection timeout**: 60 seconds
- **Reconnection attempts**: 5 with exponential backoff
- **Circuit breaker**: Activate after 5 consecutive failures

## **API Contract Benefits for Flutter**

### **Integration Advantages**

- **Type Safety**: Auto-generated Dart models from OpenAPI spec
- **Real-time Streams**: Natural fit with `StreamBuilder` widgets
- **Error Handling**: Structured error types for UI state management
- **Offline Support**: Clear historical endpoints for local caching

### **Performance Characteristics**

- **Latency**: <50ms WebSocket overhead, <200ms end-to-end
- **Throughput**: 5k+ updates/second per connection
- **Efficiency**: 120 bytes per standard tick, 80 bytes compressed
- **Scalability**: Connection pooling and load balancing ready

### **Implementation Strategy**

- **Connection Management**: Single WebSocket with multiplexed symbols
- **Data Transformation**: Server timestamps converted to local time
- **Quality Control**: Adaptive throttling based on device performance
- **Cache Integration**: Historical data populates local cache on startup

## **BLoC State Management**

### **Core BLoCs**

## Flutter State Management Architecture (Toggle)

## **Primary BLoCs**

### **ChartBloc** - Core Chart Data Management

```dart
0States:
├── ChartInitial
├── ChartLoading
├── ChartLoaded(ohlcData, currentPrice, volume)
├── ChartUpdating(newTick)
└── ChartError(error, canRetry)

Events:
├── LoadChart(symbol, timeframe)
├── SubscribeToTicks(symbol)
├── UpdateTick(priceData)
├── ZoomChart(scale, center)
└── PanChart(offset)

Responsibilities:
• Manage OHLC data aggregation
• Process real-time ticks → candlesticks
• Handle zoom/pan transformations

├── IndicatorsReady(movingAverages, bollingerBands)
└── IndicatorsError(error)

Events:
├── CalculateMovingAverage(period, type)
├── CalculateBollingerBands(period, deviation)
├── UpdateIndicatorSettings(config)
└── ClearIndicators

Responsibilities:
• Real-time indicator calculations
• Configurable parameters (period, type)
• Efficient algorithm implementation
• Memory management for large datasets
• Overlay rendering coordination

```

## **Widget State Patterns**

### **StatefulWidget Usage** (Minimal - Performance Critical)

```dart
CrosshairWidget:
  └── Local state for gesture tracking
  └── No BLoC dependency for 60fps updates

ZoomPanController:
  └── Transform matrix state
  └── GestureDetector callbacks
  └── Hardware acceleration enabled

```

### **StatelessWidget + BLoC** (Primary Pattern)

```dart
LiveChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(context) {
    return BlocBuilder<ChartBloc, ChartState>(
      buildWhen: (prev, curr) => curr.shouldRebuildChart,
      builder: (context, state) {
        return CustomPaint(
          painter: CandlestickPainter(
            data: state.ohlcData,
            currentTick: state.latestTick
          )
        );
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## **Performance Optimizations**

### **Widget Rebuild Minimization**

| Strategy | Implementation | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **buildWhen** | Conditional BlocBuilder rebuilds | 80% reduction in rebuilds |
| **RepaintBoundary** | Isolate expensive paintings | Prevents cascade repaints |
| **const Constructors** | Immutable widget optimization | Widget tree reuse |
| **GlobalKey** | Preserve widget state | Avoid unnecessary dispose/init |

### **Custom Painting Strategy**

```dart
class CandlestickPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CandlestickPainter oldDelegate) {
    // Only repaint if data actually changed
    return data.lastUpdate != oldDelegate.data.lastUpdate;
  }

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Hardware-accelerated drawing
    // Batch operations for performance
    // Use Paint objects with caching
  }
}

```

## **State Persistence Strategy**

### **Local Storage Architecture**

```yaml
HiveDB (Primary):
  ├── chart_data/
  │   ├── EURUSD_1m.hive  # OHLC data
  │   ├── GBPUSD_5m.hive  # Timeframe-specific
  │   └── cache_meta.hive # Metadata & timestamps
  │
  ├── user_preferences/
  │   ├── chart_settings.hive
  │   └── indicator_config.hive
  │
  └── auth_cache/
      └── session_data.hive # Non-sensitive only

SharedPreferences (Settings):
  ├── theme_mode
  ├── default_timeframe
  ├── performance_mode
  └── notification_settings

FlutterSecureStorage (Security):
  ├── jwt_access_token
  ├── jwt_refresh_token
  └── biometric_key

```

### **Cache Management**

| Data Type | TTL | Storage | Sync Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Live Ticks** | 5 minutes | Memory | Real-time update |
| **OHLC Data** | 24 hours | HiveDB | Background sync |
| **User Settings** | Permanent | SharedPrefs | Immediate persist |
| **Auth Tokens** | Token lifetime | Secure Storage | Auto-refresh |

## **Error Handling Pattern**

### **BLocListener Error Boundary**

```dart
MultiBlocListener(
  listeners: [
    BlocListener<ChartBloc, ChartState>(
      listenWhen: (prev, curr) => curr is ChartError,
      listener: (context, state) {
        if (state is ChartError) {
          _showErrorSnackbar(state.error);
          if (state.canRetry) _scheduleRetry();
        }
      },
    ),
    // Additional error listeners...
  ],
  child: ChartScreen()
)

```

### **Graceful Degradation**

| Error Type | User Experience | Recovery Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Network Loss** | "Reconnecting..." indicator | Auto-reconnect with cached data |
| **Auth Expired** | Biometric re-auth prompt | Seamless token refresh |
| **Data Gap** | "Loading missing data" | Historical data backfill |
| **Memory Low** | Reduce data retention | Aggressive cache cleanup |

## **Component Communication**

### **Event Bus Pattern** (Cross-BLoC Communication)

```dart
// Global events that affect multiple BLoCs
enum AppEvent {
  networkStatusChanged,
  authenticationExpired,
  performanceModeToggled,
  marketStatusChanged
}

// BLoCs subscribe to relevant global events
StreamBloc.listen(AppEvent.networkStatusChanged);
ChartBloc.listen(AppEvent.performanceModeToggled);

```

### **Repository Pattern** (Data Layer Abstraction)

```dart
abstract class ChartRepository {
  Stream<PriceTick> getRealtimeStream(String symbol);
  Future<List<OHLCBar>> getHistoricalData(String symbol, TimeFrame tf);
  Future<void> cacheData(String symbol, List<OHLCBar> data);
}

class WebSocketChartRepository implements ChartRepository {
  // WebSocket + REST implementation
}

```

# 5, Performance & Resilience Strategy

*Frame‑rate control, data aggregation, reconnection logic, offline cache*

## **Frame Rate Control**

### **Rendering Pipeline Optimization**

| Component | Target FPS | Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chart Canvas | 60 FPS | Frame throttling | Ticker with 16ms intervals |
| Price Updates | 20 FPS | Batch aggregation | Buffer ticks for 50ms windows |
| Indicators | 15 FPS | Lazy calculation | Calculate on pan/zoom only |
| UI Controls | 60 FPS | Separate render layers | RepaintBoundary isolation |

### **Adaptive Performance Control**

```yaml
Performance Modes:
  High Performance:    # Premium devices
    - 60fps rendering
    - Real-time indicators
    - Full visual effects
    
  Balanced:           # Standard devices  
    - 30fps rendering
    - 200ms tick throttling
    - Essential indicators only
    
  Battery Saver:      # Low-power mode
    - 15fps rendering
    - 1000ms tick throttling
    - Static indicators
```

---

## **Data Aggregation Strategy**

### **Real-time Tick Processing**

## Performance & Resilience Strategy (Toggle)

## **Data Aggregation Pipeline**

### **Tick-to-OHLC Conversion**

```yaml
Input: 5000 ticks/second → Output: 60 updates/second

Stage 1 - Tick Buffer:
  └── Collect ticks in 16ms windows
  └── Maximum 83 ticks per frame
  └── Memory pool: 1000 tick capacity

Stage 2 - OHLC Aggregation:
  └── Update current candle OHLC
  └── Volume accumulation
  └── Time-based candle completion

Stage 3 - UI Update:
  └── Emit state change event
  └── Trigger CustomPainter repaint
  └── Update technical indicators

```

### **Memory Management**

| Data Type | Retention Policy | Cleanup Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Live Ticks** | 5 minutes rolling | LRU eviction |
| **1m Candles** | 24 hours | Background compression |
| **5m+ Candles** | 30 days | Persistent storage |
| **Indicators** | Current viewport | Lazy calculation |

## **Network Resilience Framework**

### **Connection State Machine**

```yaml
States:
  Connected:
    └── Normal operation, heartbeat every 30s

  Reconnecting:
    └── Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s (max)
    └── Circuit breaker: Stop after 5 consecutive failures

  Degraded:
    └── Fallback to Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    └── Reduced update frequency (1s intervals)

  Offline:
    └── Cache-only mode
    └── Show last known data with timestamp

```

### **Data Gap Recovery**

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery Method | Time to Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Short Gap** (<30s) | Missing sequence numbers | Request gap fill | <2 seconds |
| **Medium Gap** (30s-5min) | Heartbeat timeout | Historical data fetch | <10 seconds |
| **Long Gap** (>5min) | Connection restored | Full chart reload | <30 seconds |
| **Symbol Unavailable** | Error response | Fallback to cached data | Immediate |

## **Offline Cache Architecture**

### **Storage Hierarchy**

```yaml
Level 1 - Memory Cache (Hot Data):
  Capacity: 50MB
  Content: Current session ticks, active indicators
  Eviction: LRU with 5-minute TTL

Level 2 - Local Database (Warm Data):
  Storage: HiveDB encrypted boxes
  Content: Historical OHLC, user preferences
  Retention:
    - 1m data: 7 days
    - 5m data: 30 days
    - 1h+ data: 1 year

Level 3 - Persistent Storage (Cold Data):
  Storage: SQLite with compression
  Content: Long-term historical data
  Retention: Configurable (1-10 years)

```

### **Cache Synchronization**

```yaml
Startup Sequence:
  1. Load user preferences (SharedPrefs)
  2. Restore last chart state (HiveDB)
  3. Connect to real-time stream
  4. Background sync missing data
  5. Update cache timestamps

Background Sync:
  - Hourly: Update historical gaps
  - Daily: Compress old tick data
  - Weekly: Clean expired cache entries
  - On WiFi: Preload additional timeframes

```

## **Battery Optimization Strategy**

### **Power-Aware Rendering**

| Battery Level | Rendering Strategy | Update Frequency | Background Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **>50%** | Full performance mode | 60fps, real-time | Normal WebSocket |
| **20-50%** | Balanced mode | 30fps, 200ms throttle | Reduced calculations |
| **<20%** | Power saver mode | 15fps, 1s throttle | Essential updates only |
| **<10%** | Emergency mode | Static display | Pause non-critical streams |

### **Background Processing**

```yaml
App States:
  Foreground:
    - Full WebSocket streaming
    - Real-time UI updates
    - All features enabled

  Background (iOS/Android):
    - Maintain WebSocket connection
    - Buffer critical price alerts
    - Minimal CPU usage

  Suspended:
    - Close WebSocket gracefully
    - Save current state
    - Schedule background refresh

```

## **Error Recovery Patterns**

### **Circuit Breaker Implementation**

```yaml
Failure Threshold: 5 consecutive errors
Half-Open Duration: 30 seconds
Recovery Strategy:
  1. Log error details for debugging
  2. Increment failure counter
  3. If threshold exceeded:
     - Open circuit (block requests)
     - Start recovery timer
     - Switch to fallback mode
  4. After timer expires:
     - Allow single test request
     - If successful: Close circuit
     - If failed: Extend timer (exponential)

```

### **Graceful Degradation Levels**

| Level | Description | User Impact | Data Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0 - Optimal** | All systems operational | Full features | Real-time + historical |
